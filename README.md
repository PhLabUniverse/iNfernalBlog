# iNfernalBlog

A straight forward AJAX driven theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/), 'the' most amazing blogging platform (in our opinion though)...

**[Live Version](http://blog.infernalsoft.co.uk/)**

**[Download iNfernalBlog](https://github.com/iNfernalSoft/iNfernalBlog/archive/master.zip)**

### Features

* Supports Ghost 0.5.x
* Clean typography focused design.
* Fully responsive (includes fitvid.js for responsive video embeds).
* AJAX loading for fast, smooth transitions between posts and pages.
* SASS files included.
* Static page support.
* Featured post support.
* And so much more...

### Troubleshooting

###### The Browse Posts link isn't working

If the "Browse Posts" link is not working properly, make sure you're using the exact URL for your blog in your "config.js" file. 
I.e. if your Ghost blog is being served at "http://ghost-blog.com", do not put anything like "http://www.ghost-blog.com". The URL has to be exactly the same as your hostname.
You get my point, right?
